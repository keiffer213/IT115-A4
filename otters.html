            <ul>
                <li><u>Length:</u> Up to 2.2 ft </li>
                <li><u>Weight:</u> Up to 10 - 33 lbs </li>
                <li><u>Lifespan:</u> Up to 9 - 12 years</li>
                <li><u>Diet:</u> River otters eat a variety of aquatic wildlife, such as fish, crayfish, crabs, frogs, birds' eggs, birds and reptiles such as turtles. They have also been known to eat aquatic plants and to prey on other small mammals, such as muskrats or rabbits.
                </li>
                <li><u>Threats:</u>  Residential & Commercial development, mining & quarrying, hunting & trapping, logging & wood harvesting, Dams & water management, diseases, and pollution.
                </li> 
                <li><u>Distribution:</u>  Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland I, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nunavut, Nova Scotia, Québec, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Ontario, Labrador, Alberta); United States (Rhode Island, Virginia, Montana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Mississippi, Georgia, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Hawaiian Is., Iowa, Utah, Nebraska, New York, Delaware, Washington, Connecticut, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada, California, North Carolina, New Jersey, Texas, Arizona, Vermont, Maine, Louisiana, South Carolina, Kansas, Idaho, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Oregon, Colorado, District of Columbia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, Alaska, Wyoming, Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama, Massachusetts, Missouri, Florida) </li>
                <li><u>Conservation Status:</u>  Listed as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN, protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act
                </li>
                <li><u>Sightings in the Pacific Northwest:</u> Although seldom seen, river otters are relatively common throughout Washington in ponds, lakes, rivers, sloughs, estuaries, bays, and in open waters along the coast. In colder locations, otters frequent areas that remain ice-free in winter—rapids, the outflows of lakes, and waterfalls. River otters avoid polluted waterways, but will seek out a concentrated food source upstream in urban areas. </li>
